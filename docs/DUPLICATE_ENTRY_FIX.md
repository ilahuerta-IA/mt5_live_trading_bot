## 🐛 Bug Description

The bot was opening **MULTIPLE TRADES on the same symbol** without waiting for the first position to close. This violates the original strategy rule: **"Only one position allowed at a time"**.

### Evidence from Real Execution:

**EURUSD Trade #1** (19:35:03):
```
[19:35:03] ✅ EURUSD: BREAKOUT detected - Entry conditions met! Price: 1.16288
[19:35:03] ✅ Order #11386157 executed @ 1.16306
[19:35:03] 🎯 EURUSD: Trade executed successfully!
[19:35:03] ✅ EURUSD: Fast path completed successfully | Phase: SCANNING  ← BUG: Reset immediately!
```

**Between the two trades**:
```
[19:50:04] 🔴 EURUSD: EMA CROSSED BELOW - BEARISH! (Invalidation)
[20:05:01] 🎯 EURUSD: LONG CROSSOVER - ARMED_LONG
[20:10:01] 🔴 EURUSD: EMA CROSSED BELOW - BEARISH! (Another invalidation)
[20:15:02] 🎯 EURUSD: LONG CROSSOVER - ARMED_LONG (Again)
```

**EURUSD Trade #2** (20:25:03 - **50 minutes later**):
```
[20:25:03] ✅ EURUSD: BREAKOUT detected - Entry conditions met! Price: 1.16245
[20:25:03] ✅ Order #11386805 executed @ 1.16266  ← DUPLICATE ENTRY!
```

**Problem**: The first position (#11386157) was still OPEN when the bot executed the second entry (#11386805).

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Original Code (WRONG):
```python
# Line 1862-1868 (OLD)
if trade_executed:
    self.terminal_log(f"🎯 {symbol}: Trade executed successfully!", "SUCCESS")
else:
    self.terminal_log(f"⚠️ {symbol}: Trade execution failed!", "WARNING")

# ❌ BUG: Immediate reset allows new entries even if position is still open
self._reset_entry_state(symbol)
entry_state = 'SCANNING'
```

### Why It Failed:
1. **Immediate Reset**: Bot reset state to `SCANNING` right after opening the trade
2. **No Position Tracking**: Bot didn't track that position was still open
3. **New Signals Accepted**: Bot accepted new crossover signals while first trade was active
4. **Duplicate Entry**: Bot opened second position on same symbol

### Original Strategy Behavior:
From `sunrise_ogle_*.py` documentation (Line 18):
> **"Only one position allowed at a time - conflicts result in position closure"**

The original backtrader strategies automatically prevent duplicate entries because `self.position` exists until SL/TP closes it.

---

## ✅ The Fix

### New Code (CORRECT):

**1. After Trade Execution** (Lines 1868-1877):
```python
if trade_executed:
    self.terminal_log(f"🎯 {symbol}: Trade executed successfully!", "SUCCESS")
    # ✅ FIX: Set to IN_TRADE state instead of immediate reset
    current_state['entry_state'] = 'IN_TRADE'
    current_state['phase'] = 'TRADE_ACTIVE'
    entry_state = 'IN_TRADE'
    self.terminal_log(f"🔒 {symbol}: State locked - Will not accept new signals until position closes", 
                    "INFO", critical=True)
else:
    self.terminal_log(f"⚠️ {symbol}: Trade execution failed!", "WARNING")
    # Only reset if trade failed
    self._reset_entry_state(symbol)
    entry_state = 'SCANNING'
```

**2. At Start of Processing** (Lines 1461-1481):
```python
# ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Check for open positions BEFORE any processing
if entry_state == 'IN_TRADE':
    positions = mt5.positions_get(symbol=symbol)
    if positions is None or len(positions) == 0:
        # Position closed (by SL/TP) - Reset state to allow new entries
        self.terminal_log(f"🔓 {symbol}: Position closed - Unlocking for new signals", 
                        "INFO", critical=True)
        self._reset_entry_state(symbol)
        entry_state = 'SCANNING'
        current_state['entry_state'] = 'SCANNING'
    else:
        # Position still open - Skip all processing
        self.terminal_log(f"🔒 {symbol}: Position still open (Ticket #{positions[0].ticket}) - Skipping signal detection", 
                        "DEBUG", critical=False)
        return 'IN_TRADE'
```

### How It Works Now:

**Correct Flow**:
1. Bot opens trade EURUSD #1 @ 19:35 ✅
2. Bot sets state to `IN_TRADE` (NOT SCANNING) ✅
3. Bot **skips all signal detection** while position is open ✅
4. When position closes (SL/TP), bot detects closure ✅
5. Bot resets state to `SCANNING` ✅
6. Bot **NOW** can accept new signals ✅

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: Trade Opened
```
[19:35:03] ✅ EURUSD: Order #11386157 executed
[19:35:03] 🔒 EURUSD: State locked - Will not accept new signals
[19:35:03] Phase: IN_TRADE
```

### Scenario 2: While Trade is Open (New Signals IGNORED)
```
[20:15:02] 🎯 EURUSD: LONG CROSSOVER detected
[20:15:02] 🔒 EURUSD: Position still open (Ticket #11386157) - Skipping signal detection
[20:15:02] ⏭️ NO NEW TRADE (BLOCKED)
```

### Scenario 3: Position Closes, New Signals Accepted
```
[20:30:00] 💰 EURUSD: Position #11386157 hit TP and closed
[20:30:00] 🔓 EURUSD: Position closed - Unlocking for new signals
[20:30:00] Phase: SCANNING
[20:35:00] 🎯 EURUSD: LONG CROSSOVER detected
[20:40:00] ✅ EURUSD: New trade #11386805 can be opened NOW ✅
```

## 🔒 Impact Assessment

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Bot could open 2+ positions on same symbol simultaneously
- ❌ Violates "one position at a time" rule
- ❌ Doubles risk exposure
- ❌ Can cause margin issues on small accounts

### After Fix:
- ✅ Bot enforces ONE position per symbol
- ✅ Matches original strategy behavior exactly
- ✅ Proper risk management maintained
- ✅ No duplicate entries possible

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test: Bot opens first trade, state becomes `IN_TRADE`
- [ ] Test: While position open, new crossovers are IGNORED
- [ ] Test: Position hits SL, state resets to `SCANNING`
- [ ] Test: After reset, new crossovers are ACCEPTED
- [ ] Test: Position hits TP, state resets correctly
- [ ] Test: Multiple symbols can have positions simultaneously (EURUSD + XAUUSD)
- [ ] Verify logs show:
  - `🔒 State locked` after trade execution
  - `🔒 Position still open` when skipping signals
  - `🔓 Position closed - Unlocking` when ready for new trades

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Never reset state immediately after trade execution**
2. **Always verify position is closed before accepting new signals**
3. **Use IN_TRADE state to lock symbol during active position**
4. **Check MT5 positions_get() to confirm closure**
5. **Match original strategy's "one position at a time" rule**
